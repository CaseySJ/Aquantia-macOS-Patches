# Aquantia-macOS-Patches
Patches to enable AppleEthernetAquantiaAqtion driver in Monterey and Ventura when AppleVTD is not available

There are 8 patches in the .plist file. The first six belong to Set 1. The last two belong to Set 2. Either Set 1 or Set 2 patches may be used depending on your preference. Do not enable both Set 1 and Set 2 patches at the same time. All patches from a set must be enabled in order to operate the Aquantia 10GbE card properly.

These patches have been tested with AQC-107 and AQC-113 controllers running under Monterey and Ventura. 

These patches should not be used in Big Sur or Monterey 12.1 and 12.2. The patches apply only to Monterey 12.3 and later (which includes all versions of Ventura).
